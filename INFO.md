https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp
RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a price change to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. 
The RSI is considered:
- Over<b>bought</b> when above 70 
- Over<b>sold</b> when below 30.

It can also indicate assets that may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy or sell an asset.

- Provices signals about bullish or bearish price momentum, often plotted beneath the graph of an asset's price.
- The RSI line crossing  below the overbought line or above the oversold line can be used as a signal to buy or sell an asset.
- RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets.

#### How it works
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index compares an assets strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how an asset may perform. The RSI, used in conjuction with other thenical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.

#### Calculating the RSI
RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:

$$RSI_{step one} = 100 - \ {\frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{average gain}{average loss}}}$$


The average gain and loss in this calculation is tha average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher sever out of the past 14 days with an average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an average loss of -0.8%. The RSI would be calculated as follows:

#### Risks
Fully relying on RSI would not be good since it doesn'ta take econimic news, earnings and fundamental data into account. It is a good idea to combine it with other indicators. Additionally, RSI can remain overbought or oversold for long periods of time. Usually paired with volume and the overall trend of the asset.


### Accumulation/Distribution indicator

#### How it works
The A/D indicator is a volume-measurement tool that assesses the cumulative inflow and outflow of money of a given asset. It measures price and colume of tha asset for ascertain wether iti is being accumulated or distributed. It provides insight on the strength of the current trend and can be used to identify potential reversals. If the A/D line is rising, it indicates that the asset is being accumulated. If the A/D line is falling, it indicates that the asset is being distributed. Having a rising asset but a falling A/D line indicates that the asset is being distributed at a faster rate than it is being accumulated. This can be a sign of a potential reversal. It looks at the relation between the value and the volume of the asset. Accumulations refers to the buying level fot that security given a specific period.
Distributuions refers to the selling level for that security given a specific period.


$$Money Flow Multiplier = \frac{(Close - Low) - (High - Close)}{High - Low}$$

$$Money Flow Volume = Money Flow Multiplier \times Volume$$

$$Accumulation/Distribution = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Money Flow Volume$$

### Average True Range

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp
#### How it works
Measure volatility in terms of pips or movements in price.
Rising ATR means the volatility is increasing. Whilst the falling ATR means the volatility is decreasing. Can be used to know when to exit a trade. If you enter a long buying period and the ATR is rising, you can expect the price to rise more. If you enter a short selling period and the ATR is rising, you can expect the price to fall more. If you enter a long buying period and the ATR is falling, you can expect the price to rise less. If you enter a short selling period and the ATR is falling, you can expect the price to fall less.

This is a subjective measure, meaning that it is open to interpretation. There is no single ATR value that will tell you with any certainty that a trend is about to reverse or not. Instead, ATR eadings should always be compared against earlier readings to get a feel of a trend’s strength or weakness.

#### Formula
$$TR = max[(High - Low), Abs(High - Close_{previous}), Abs(Low - Close_{previous})]$$

$$ATR = (\frac{1}{n}) \sum_{i=1}^{n} TR_{i}$$

### Bollinger Band
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp
#### How it works
It is used as an indicator to measure volatility and can also be used to measure if an asset is overbought or oversold. To see if the asset value is oversold or overbought, you can compare the current price to the upper and lower bands. If the price is above the upper band, it is considered overbought. If the price is below the lower band, it is considered oversold. The bands can also be used to identify potential reversals. If the price is above the upper band and the price starts to fall, it can be a sign of a potential reversal. If the price is below the lower band and the price starts to rise, it can be a sign of a potential reversal.

Roughly 90% of the asset price actions occur between the two bands. Any breakout above or below the bands can be considered a major event. The breakout is not a trading signal. Breakouts provice no clue as to the direction and extend of future price movement.

#### Formula
$$Typical Price = \frac{High + Low + Close}{3}$$

$$Upper BollingerBand = Moving Average(Typical Price, periods) + m * Standard Deviation(Typical Price, periods)$$

$$Lower BollingerBand = Moving Average(Typical Price, periods) - m * Standard Deviation(Typical Price, periods)$$


### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp
#### How it works
MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between the two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting th 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA, these periods can be adjusted but these are the commonly used values.

An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.

MACD is a lagging indicator. After all, all the data used in MACD is based on the historical price action of the stock. Since it is based on historical data, it must necessarily "lag" in price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of the MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator for future trend changes.

#### Formula
$$MACD = EMA_{12} - EMA_{26}$$



### Money Flow Index (MFI)

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfi.asp
#### How it works
It is a technical indicator that generates overbought or oversold signals. It incorporates both price and volume data, as opposed to just price. For this reason, some analysts call MFI the volume-weighted RSI.

An MSI reading abond 80 is considered overbought and and MFI reading below 20 is considered oversold, although levels of 90 and 10 are also often used as thresholds.

A divergence between the indicator and price is noteworthy. For example, if the indicator is rising while the price is falling or flat. The price could start rising.

#### Formula
$$Money Flow Index = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + Money Flow Ratio}$$
$$Money Flow Ratio = \frac{14 Period Positive Money Flow}{14 Period Negative Money Flow}$$
$$Raw Money Flow = Typical Price \times Volume$$
$$Typical Price = \frac{High + Low + Close}{3}$$

### Parabolic SAR indicator (PSAR)

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parabolicindicator.asp
#### How it works
The Parabolic SAR indicator, is used by traders to determine trend direction and portential reversal price. The indicator uses a trailing stop and reverse method called Stop And Reverse (SAR), to identify suitable exit and entry points. Traders also refer to the indicator as the parabolic stop and reverse, parabolic SAR, or PSAR.

The PSAR indicator appears on a chart as a series of dots, either above or below and asset's price, depending on the direction the price is moving. A dot is placed below the price when it is trending upward, and above the price when it is trending downward.

- Used to spot trend and potential reversals
- Utilizes a system of dots superimposed onto a price chart
- A reversal occurs when these dots flip, but a reversal signal in the SAR does not necessarily mean a reversal in the price. A PSAR only means that the price and indicator have crossed.

#### Formula
$$RisingPSAR = PSAR_{previous} + AF$$
$$FallingPSAR = PSAR_{previous} - AF$$

##### Where 
- AF = Acceleration Factor (starts with 0.02 and increases by 0.02 each time the SAR changes direction, up to a maximum of 0.2)
- EP = Extreme Point (the highest high for a long position, or the lowest low for a short position)


### Tripple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-exponential-moving-average.asp
#### How it works
The TEMA was designed to smooth price fluctuations, thereby making it easier to identify trends without the lag associated with traditional moving averages. It does this by taking multiple EMAs of the original EMA and subtracting out some of the lag.
The TEMA is used like other MAs. It can help identify trend direction, signal potential short-term trend changes or pullbacks, and provice support or resistance. The TEMA can be compared to the double exponential moving average (DEMA).

#### Formula
$$TEMA = (3 * EMA_{1}) - (3 * EMA_{2}) + EMA_{3}$$

##### Where
- EMA_{1} = Exponential Moving Average of the price
- EMA_{2} = Exponential Moving Average of EMA_{1}
- EMAS_{3} = Exponential Moving Average of EMA_{2}



## Progress

### Preprocessing
The first week I was mostly doing preprocessing in C. Making this in a faster language was necessary for speed, doing this in python proved to be very slow. 
The data candle data that looks like this:

| Index | event_time    | open       | close      | high       | low        | volume   |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 0     | 1643214300000 | 0.05606000 | 0.05611000 | 0.05611000 | 0.05605000 | 213878.1 |
| 1     | 1643214360000 | 0.05612000 | 0.05617000 | 0.05619000 | 0.05608000 | 242867.6 |

Using this data I could calculate some indicators:
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Accumulation/Distribution Oscilator (ADOSC)
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Bollinger Bands (BB)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
- Parabolic SAR indicator (PSAR)
- Tripple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

After adding the indicators I normalized all the data. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preprocessing for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information. 

### Creating my environment
Creating a new environment is very hard since you have to get the rewards exactly right for it to work properly. This is a huge pitfall for me. 
Since the data is imbalanced (there is more off the class `hold` than there is `buy` or `sell`) I had to make sure that the model buys and sells at exactly the right time. 
The model was always overfitting to one class, which was the `hold` class. But eventually I was training my model and saw that it was actually learning something: Not selling multiple times after eachother which is bad since you can't sell after you already sold everything. This also forced the model to work in pairs (`buy` and `sell`). Also, it started to understand the `buy` signal. It ofter decides to `buy`  in a valley.  
![[alternating_buy_sell.png]]
The environment is far from ideal and could still use a lot of work.
### Model

## Why am I using Reinforcement Learning?

### Sequence of decisions
Using standard supervised learning techniques limit the AI in the sense that it will not be able to make multiple decisions that impact eachother. For example, in order for my model to be able to make profits, the model has to sell. But without buying any crypto stock, you can't make a profit. So making profits is based on a sequence of actions or decisions. 

### Outperforming existing methods
Using Reinforment Learning makes it possible to outperform any existing methods as it can learn more from the environment itself, as opposed to only the methods applied during training in supervised learning.

This is especially usefull since I only have limited knowledge of trading crypto currencies and don't have a lot of experience. We could still use supervised learning to make the model know the environment faster, replacing the long and tedious exploration of the environment. Ofcourse this can only be done for a small portion of the training, since it would remove the benefit of reinforcement learning.

While supervised learning is almost only pre-programmed knowledge, Reinforcement Learning methods also require some existing knowledge which subsequently makes the system less autonomous [2, p. 274], but increases the chances of the agent finding the optimal policy. 

### Rewards
I chose to work with more local reinforcement signals over a reward signal at the end of a sequence. This should significantly increase the speed of learning [2, p. 275]

## Why am I using a LSTM model?

### Previous models RNN architectures
In the past there have been numerous RNN architectures that had some error when it comes to data in the past. LSTM solves this issue with backpropagation where the model can determine if data should be memorized or forgotten.
This makes LSTM a great solution to time series data, since experiences in the past very often have a large impact on the prediction or outcome.

Research found that RNNs have long time lags were inaccessible to existing architectures, because backgpropageted error eiter blows up or decays exponentially [3, p. 799-800].

A LSTM model is also capable of using an entire sequence of data as input instead of only the one sample. Which is an ideal for processing and prediction data.

## Why am I using Deep Reinforcement Learning?

### Infinite states
Crypto currency trading has a lot of data, which is why it also involves using a lot of states. Having many states will result in greater difficulty for agents without a neural network, since I cannot save all the states at once in memory.
